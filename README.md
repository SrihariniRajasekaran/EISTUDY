  ##EXCERCISE-1: Problem Statement on Design patterns
  ###1.CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERN: It Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
                Two use cases to demonstrate two behavioural design pattern.
                ####i)Singleton Pattern: 
                    Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
                  Example:Logger
                ####ii) Factory Pattern:
                    Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
                  Example:Tranpertation mode
 ###2.STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERN:These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
                    Two use cases to demonstrate two creational design pattern.
                  ####i)Adapter Pattern:
                      Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
                  Example: Temperature Sensor Adapter
                  ####ii)Facade Pattern:
                      Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
                    Example: HomeTheater System
  ###3. BEHAVIOURAL DESIGN PATTERN:These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
                    Two use cases to demonstrate two structural design pattern.
                    ####i)Observer Pattern:
                        Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.
                     Example:Weather Station
                    ####ii)Command Pattern:
                         Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a 
                         method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.
                     Example: HomeAutomation System
##EXCERCISE-2:Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer Programming Exercise
###Problem Statement
     Design and implement a console-based application that helps astronauts organize their daily schedules. The application should allow users to add, remove, and view daily tasks. Each task will have a description, start time, end time, and priority level. The intent behind this problem statement is to evaluate your ability to implement a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, manage data efficiently, and apply best coding practices
